## User Stories

User navigates to the site and interacts by clicking on listings and being able to see pictures of the listings as well as things like price, location, number of bedrooms, beds, and baths. Users are also going to be able to edit listings to their liking and also having the ability to delete listings. Users will be able to enjoy and browse the website like it is actually Airbnb.

Three key features for our MVP:
1. Search for any track due to Spotify API
2. Creating and storing playlists
3. Ability to Like tracks and add them to a Liked playlist

## User Flow

An improvement to our design that we wish we could have added was User Authentication.
Another big improvement we wanted to add was the ability to actually filter the listings by type or location.
Another implementation that we did not get to was being able to search for listings as well.

## Summary

Kevin: I learned the most in this project so far as it really pushed me in my understanding of React, the front-end, as well as reviewing my knowledge of the back-end. I thoroughly enjoyed doing this project with Darion as we pair-programmed most of the CSS together as well. We both primarily worked on the back-end and then pair-programmed the CSS/front-end. Gave me a better understanding of React and CSS.

Darion: I learned the most this project as well. Solidified some past lessons as well as learned new concepts in React such as useState, fetching data from an API, and learned new CSS properties. This project gave me a better overall understanding of CSS.
